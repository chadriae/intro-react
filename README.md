# First React-app

I'm building a to-do app! How exciting is that?!

## Tools used

I admit: I used a YouTube tutorial to get the core concepts of React and to build this to do-app, but I did some custom styling and code enhancements.

- VSCode
- React.js as JS Framework
- Scss for styling
- React live clock for everything date-related
- React icons for everything icon-related
- Unsplash for backgrounds
- Quotes Free Api for inspirational quotes
- Netlify

And huge thanks to Dev Ed for the tutorial.
